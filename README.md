hudl-dev-sensei
===============

This is a Chrome extension for Hudl's dev sensei award nominations. It uses the [GitHub Users API](https://developer.github.com/v3/users/)
to fill in the email of the currently logged in GitHub user, as well as the email of the user receiving a nomination, provided a comment
button is clicked. Because of the nature of the API, only accounts with publicly visible email addresses will have their email information
filled in.
